## OpenSense data format convetions
In this repository code and example files to illustrate standard data formats and naming conventions derived from the [OpenSense Action](https://opensenseaction.eu/) 
are collected.    

#### Data
We use the [OpenMRG dataset](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-5411-2022) as CML exampele data and PWS data from an dataset of [Amsterdam and the 
Netherlands](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Rainfall_observations_datasets_from_Personal_Weather_Stations/12703250). Example notebooks show how to bring these 
datasets to the proposed data formats. This accompanies the white paper on standards and convetions can be found here: ..
