## NetCDF specifications of CML, SML, and PWS
In this folder netCDF_specifications will be stored in AsciiDoc format similarly as done by  https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions but more lightweight.

The motivation is:
- Manage updates using standard Git procedures
- Enable versioning and version releases
- Enable presentation of new versions of OS conventions in a human readable form (either through GitHub, or Action website, or a pdf document)
- Possibly enable parsing of specifications by OS netCDF libraries

## AsciiDoc format
AsciiDoc format is a plaintext format which is easy to write and easy to parse. There are many tools to convert it to other formats such as html or pdf and GitHub can automaticaly preview it. 

## Usage
Preview adoc files on gitHub webpagesite or fork it/download it and open it in any plain text editor.
